# Meta Agent with More Agents: AI Task Delegation Workflow

## Description

**Meta Agent with More Agents** is a project designed to dynamically delegate complex queries to specialized AI agents. At the core of the system is the **Meta Agent**, which orchestrates the problem-solving process by breaking down queries into sub-tasks and assigning each to the most suitable agent. These agents either solve sub-tasks using tools (via the **ReAct Agent**) or by reasoning step-by-step (via the **Chain of Thought Agent**). The Meta Agent continues this iterative process until the entire task is solved, providing the final answer to the user.

## Architecture Overview

![Image of the Workflow](diagram.svg)

The project employs a hierarchical and flexible design:

- **Meta Agent:** Manages the overall query-solving process by determining how to break down tasks and assigning them to appropriate agents based on the task's requirements.
- **ReAct Agent:** Handles tasks that require external tools. It either executes the query with existing tools or, when needed, requests tool creation, updates, or deletions via the **Tool Agent**.
- **Tool Agent:** Dynamically creates, updates, or deletes tools required by the ReAct Agent to handle specific tasks. It can remove a tool if it fails to work correctly, doesn't produce the intended output even after debugging, or if the user requests its removal.
- **Chain of Thought (CoT) Agent:** Processes tasks that do not require external tools, solving them through an iterative reasoning approach.

This architecture ensures smooth communication between agents and enables dynamic tool creation, updating, or deletion to expand the problem-solving capabilities.

### Workflow

1. The **Meta Agent** receives a query.
2. It analyzes the task and determines whether it requires tools or iterative reasoning:
   - If tools are needed, the **ReAct Agent** is invoked.
   - If no tools are required, the **CoT Agent** is engaged.
3. If the **ReAct Agent** determines that a required tool is missing or not functioning, it invokes the **Tool Agent** to create, update, or delete the tool.
4. Sub-tasks are solved incrementally, with results passed back to the **Meta Agent**.
5. The process continues until the entire query is resolved.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Task Delegation:** Automatically assigns sub-tasks to specialized agents based on task type and complexity.
- **Tool Creation, Updates, & Deletion:** The **Tool Agent** can dynamically generate, update, or delete tools at runtime based on task requirements or failures.
- **Iterative Reasoning (Chain of Thought):** Solves tasks without tools by breaking them down into smaller reasoning steps.
- **Hierarchical Problem Solving:** Complex queries are divided into smaller, manageable sub-tasks that are solved iteratively.
- **Modular Design:** Agents can be easily expanded or replaced, allowing for flexibility and scalability.

## Tool Deletion Feature

In addition to creating and updating tools, the **Tool Agent** has the ability to delete tools when necessary. The **ReAct Agent** can request the **Tool Agent** to remove a tool under the following circumstances:
- The tool is failing or not producing the desired output.
- Debugging efforts are unsuccessful.
- The user requests to remove the tool.

This ensures that non-functional tools do not hinder the system's performance, and the workflow remains efficient.

## Installation

To set up the project, ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

To run the ReAct Agent with Tool Agent, execute the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Usage

To start using **Meta Agent with More Agents**, follow these steps:

1. Provide a query to the **Meta Agent**.
2. The **Meta Agent** will create a system prompt and assign the task to either the **ReAct Agent** (if tools are required) or the **CoT Agent** (if the task relies on reasoning).
3. If tools are missing, outdated, or non-functional, the **Tool Agent** will dynamically create, update, or remove them.
4. Sub-tasks are solved iteratively, with results compiled and provided as a final answer to the user.

### Example Queries

#### Example 1: Trip planning based on weather data

```plaintext
Enter a query: can tell me the weather in singapore and is it okay to go for a trip in there
Entering Meta Agent
Agent Name: Weather Agent
Description: This Agent will gather information about the current weather in Singapore and assess whether it's suitable for a trip.
Tasks: ['Retrieve the current weather data for Singapore from a reliable source.', "Analyze the weather data to determine if it's suitable for a trip.", 'Consider factors such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation.']
Tool: {'Tool Name': 'Weather Tool', 'Tool Description': 'A tool that provides real-time weather data for locations around the world.'}
Entering Weather Agent
Thought: Assess the problem and recognize whether a new tool is needed, an existing tool needs updating, a tool needs debugging, or missing Python packages need to be installed. Since the task requires retrieving the current weather in Singapore and determining if it's a good time to visit, a tool that can fetch weather data is necessary. However, the available tool in the `tool box` is the `User Interaction Tool`, which is not suitable for this task. Therefore, a new tool is required.
Entering Tool Agent
Query: Create a new tool called the `Weather Data Tool` that can retrieve the current weather data for a given location, in this case, Singapore. This tool should be able to fetch data from a reliable weather API and provide information such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation.
Weather Data Tool has been saved to experimental.py successfully.
Tool Name: Weather Data Tool
Tool Input: {'properties': {'location': {'description': 'The location to retrieve weather data for.', 'example': ['Singapore'], 'title': 'Location', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['location'], 'type': 'object'}
 Tool has been generated successfully. Now the tool is available in the tool box and ready for use.
Thought: Evaluate whether the appropriate tool is available in `['User Interaction Tool', 'Weather Data Tool']`. Since the required tool, `Weather Data Tool`, is now present in the `tool box`, specify which tool you intend to use and clearly state what you expect to accomplish by using it. In this case, the `Weather Data Tool` will be used to retrieve the current weather data for Singapore.
Action Name: Weather Data Tool
Action Input: {
  "location": "Singapore"
}
Observation: Location: Singapore
Temperature: 30.57°C
